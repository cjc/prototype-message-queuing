# Protoype Javascript Message Queuing #

Version: 1.0, Last updated: 1/5/2010

This is a Prototype library based conversion of Ban Alman's [jQuery-Message-Queuing](http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-message-queuing)

"With Prototype Message Queuing, you can process and manage operations on large queues of items or elements. You can throttle, giving each operation a little breathing room (firing tracking pixels, performing DOM manipulations). You can force multiple asynchronous operations to execute serially (AJAX requests). You can also get some quantity of JavaScript ducks, put them in a boat, in a line, and have them fight loudly over who gets to use the oars.
